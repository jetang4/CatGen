    <h2>Dominance and Recessiveness</h2>
    <p>How is it possible that two black cats have brown kittens?</p>
    <p>In the case of most traits, alleles come in both a <strong> dominant </strong> and a <strong> recessive </strong> form.
        Having two (or more) forms of each trait (alleles) allows for the level of variation we see in everything from hair color to taste certain foods.
        If you've ever wondered how out of two siblings, one has curly hair and the other straight, dominance and recessiveness can explain it.
    </p>
    <p>Dominant forms of an allele are represented by the CAPITAL form of a letter, and recessive forms are represented by the lowercase form.
        At each trait locus, you can have two forms of the alleles: both dominant, both recessive, or one of each. By convention, the dominant allele (if any) is written first</p>



    <p>Quiz time! Given that you are at the F locus, what would be the alleles for a recessive genotype?:</p>
