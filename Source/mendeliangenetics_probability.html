    <h1>Mendelian Genetics</h1>
    <h2>Probability</h2>
    <p>Applying the principles of probability to genetics problems</p>
    <p>Probability refers to the likelihood of an event occurring. In the simplest case, we can calculate the probability of an event occurring by
        dividing the chance of your event of interest occurring by total number of possible events.</p>
    <p>For example, what is the probability that a couple's baby is female? We have two possible events: male and female, and one of the two events is 'female'.
        Thus, we divide 1 by 2, resulting in the probability of having a female being 1/2 or 50%</p>
    <p>As you learned in an earlier lesson, traits can be either dominant or recessive, which is how offspring are able to look different than their parents and each other. </p>
