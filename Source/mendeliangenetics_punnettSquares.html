    <h2>Punnett Squares</h2>
    <p>Punnett Squares: Probabilities in Genetics can be better understood by the use of
        punnett squares. In a Cat, the allele for black fur (A) is dominant to the allele for
        brown color (a). When a parent has the genotype Aa and a father has the genotype
        Aa, the offspring produce depend on the inheritance of the alleles from both the
        mother and the father. An easy way to keep track of the probabilities of each is by
        the use of punnett squares. Watch this short video on punnett squares to proceed to
        the lecture quiz.</p>
